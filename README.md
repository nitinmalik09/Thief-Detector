# Thief-Detector
The Thief Detection System uses Python and OpenCV to monitor video feeds for unauthorized movement. It compares current frames with a stored background to detect motion, highlighting moving objects with a green bounding box and “UNSAFE” label. The system records and saves the video for security purposes.
